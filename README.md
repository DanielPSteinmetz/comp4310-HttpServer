I used several sites including ChatGPT to figure out the syntax of typescript and how to run/compile it with tsx and tsc.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

I had a lot of fun learning how to use typescript and decided it would help if I did another project with it first to get the hang of it. So I wrote a text compressor using Huffman codes which gave me a great foundation to do this project. I had to make some modifications to the structure of some modules and added a new one, but I think that I did fairly well with the layout and am proud of how it turned out.

I do wish I could have figured out how to get jest working with ts. I tried it with ts-jest, but it appeared the main problem was the fact that the tests existed in a test/ directory, which made some things sticky. I saw on a doc that maybe Babel is what I would need to get it working, so I may look into that later.
